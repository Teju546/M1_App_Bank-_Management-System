Custom workflow activities are one of the most important aspects of the Windows速 Workflow Found足a足tion and there are many features to consider when building them. In their January 2006 article, "Simplify Development with the Declarative Model of Windows Workflow Foundation," Don Box and Dharma Shukla discussed the core ideas of building workflows and the interactions between the workflow runtime and activities (see msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/01/WindowsWorkflow足Foundation). In this article, I will cover the core components required for building custom activities for your business domain, including runtime responsibilities, design time experience, and asynchronous activity development.
