The behavior of the autobuild step varies according to the operating system that the extraction runs on. On Windows, the autobuild step attempts to autodetect a suitable build method for C/C++ using the following approach:

Invoke MSBuild.exe on the solution (.sln) or project (.vcxproj) file closest to the root. If autobuild detects multiple solution or project files at the same (shortest) depth from the top level directory, it will attempt to build all of them.
Invoke a script that looks like a build scriptâ€”build.bat, build.cmd, and build.exe (in that order).
On Linux and macOS, the autobuild step reviews the files present in the repository to determine the build system used:

Look for a build system in the root directory.
If none are found, search subdirectories for a unique directory with a build system for C/C++.
Run an appropriate command to configure the system.
